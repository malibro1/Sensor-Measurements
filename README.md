# Sensor Measurement Report 
  This is the Sensor Measurement Project for MRE 320 with Dr. Zhang during Spring 2024 at Southern Illinois University - Edwardsville . This was done by group 3 consisting of Aurora Clark, Malina Brown, and Ethan Zumbahlen. For this project we where tasked with studying and testing three sensors; MPU6050 module, DHT-11, and Ultrasonic Ranging module.
  First we had to get familiar with the sensor and write a propsal for testing. For the proposal we had to  summarize our main findings and determine the important characteristics for each sensor. We had to find and show the wiring diagram or a picture of our connected hardware. We had to show the Arduino code and take a screenshot of the readings. Then we had to propose testing plans for each sensor of what we wanted to measure and how.
  Second we had to conduct testing of the sensors important characteristics. We had to research instructions and procedures, build testing setups and gather the data. Then we had to make a presentation that introduce the fundamentals of the sensor, show the manufacturing specs of the sensors, list the important characteristics for each sensor explaining how they were tested, collect the data, discuss the main findings findings, compare the findings to the manufacturer, and summarize your findings.
  Lastly we had to make a GitHub to compile all of our findings and testing from the proposal and presentation into one place

  # Repository
  Each folder is labeled with a sensor and in each you will find the Arduino code, the wiring diagram, and pictures of the actual experiment set up. For the testing plans you can see our proposal. Corrections/changes made will be stated in the proposal file as well. To see our findings and testing procedure see our presentation. Corrections/changes made will be stated in the presentation file as well.
